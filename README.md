# BlackDomeServer


This websocket server is for my college summative A2 development project.
The purpose of this server is to allow multiple people to vote on options and control what 
happens inside a Unity game.


To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:
> [!NOTE]  
> This server has not been tested with Node.js, but it should work as no Bun-specific APIs are used.

```bash
bun start
```
